#+TITLE: README

* Computer Science Reference Repository
This repository is a collection of reference and educational materials
gathered and organized for educational purposes. It is foremost for personal use
but I should like to also be able to distribute this as a self contained
introductory CS curricula.

* Why?
After spending years breaking linux boxes, coding as a hobbyist, enrolling in and
dropping out of school, I was looking for portable material which I
could use to help bridge the gap between tutorial hell and respectable
competence. I could not find what I was looking for. There's an enormous
wealth of resources floating around on the internet, I've bought and read
a lot of books, written a lot of code (mostly bad, but wish I had kept some of it),
and wasted a lot of my time spinning wheels in place and not getting anywhere.
This is my attempt to keep all of my notes in a single repository.

* TODO: Confirm copyright and fair use criteria.
